**Civic Audit Engine for Egypt’s Digital Resurrection**

This module anchors transparency, governance enforcement, and contributor compliance across all Pi Studio deployments. It merges the full TEOS-AI-Auditor codebase into a single AI-readable file using Repomix. Security checks are disabled to allow full-spectrum civic audit and badge-locked scan logic.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This repo contains a packed representation of the entire TEOS-AI-Auditor repository. It is optimized for:
- AI audit triggers
- Contributor flow analysis
- Governance logic verification
- Civic compliance scans

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Repomix Format**: All files merged into one document, sorted by Git change count.
- **Security Check Disabled**: Full exposure for AI systems—handle with caution.
- **Civic Enforcement**: Every scan enforces badge logic, petition signing, and flat-fee onboarding.

## 🏛️ Founder Declaration

I am Ayman Seif, architect of TEOS Egypt and Elmahrosa International. This module is not a proposal—it is a deployed operational reality. It anchors Egypt’s civic crypto gateway and enforces transparency across every Pi Studio deployment.

If you’re building inside Pi Studio, this is your audit engine.

Let’s deploy.
